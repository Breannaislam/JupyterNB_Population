# Capstone Project â€” Business Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of an undergraduate capstone course, where we worked in teams to create and manage our own simulated companies using a business simulation platform called *Capsim*. 

Throughout the simulation, our team made strategic decisions in areas like marketing, production, R&D, and finance over multiple simulated weeks. 

For my individual analysis, I focused on 3 weeks of company data. I used Python and data visualization tools to explore and explain key patterns and trends from our business performance. My analysis highlights the impact of our decisions over time, using charts and visuals for clarity.
